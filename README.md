# 🪐☄️ Asteroids Clone – Built with Pygame
A classic Asteroids-style arcade game built from scratch using pygame. Blast your way through waves of asteroids spawning from the screen edges. Large asteroids split into smaller fragments when hit, and the smallest ones are destroyed in a satisfying chain of explosions.

## 🎮 Features
- Player-controlled ship that can rotate, move and fire bullets
- Asteroids spawn from screen edges and drift across space
- Collision mechanics:
 - Bullets destroy small asteroids
 - Large asteroids split into two smaller ones when hit by a bullet
- Simple scoring system tracks asteroid hits and lifes left.
- UI for Main menu and Game Over menu.

## Upcoming Features
- Implement player respawning
- Add explosion effects when asteroids are destroyed
- Add acceleration to player movement
- Implement screen wrap-around for all objects
- Add a parallax space background image
- Create different weapon types (spread, laser, etc.)
- Make asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Give the ship a triangular hitbox instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
